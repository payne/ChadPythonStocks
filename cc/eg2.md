I have 200 shares of LVS currently valued at $77.44.   
Since the basis of that purchase is $73.82, 
I've made (77.44 - 73.82) * 200 - 7 = $717

I sell "LVS 2/23/2018 C $85.00" for 0.41/share.  This puts a cap on the potential profit on LVS.   
The cap relates to the strike price of $85/share.
cap = (84.99 - 73.82) * 200 - 7 = $2227.00.   
If LVS sells for $85 or greater, I won't make any of that profit. 
e.g. suppose LVS reaches 100/share.  lostProfit = extraGain - 2227.00 = 3002
extraGain = (100 - 73.82) * 200 - 7 = 5229.00 
So, I get an immediate gain of $73 for putting a cap, of $2227, on my profit from LVS; 
the cap lasts for about a month (2/23/18).
